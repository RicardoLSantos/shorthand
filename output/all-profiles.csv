For example, an institution may choose that BID is ""always at 7am and 6pm"".  If it is inappropriate for this choice to be made, the code BID should not be used.

One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

","Why the component result is missing","Provides a reason why the expected value in the element Observation.component.value[x] is missing.","""Null"" or exceptional values can be represented two ways in FHIR Observations.  One way is to simply include them in the value set and represent the exceptions in the value.

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.  For example, the dataAbsentReason code ""error"" could be used when the measurement was not completed.  Because of these options, use-case agreements are required to interpret general observations for exceptional values.","For many results it is necessary to handle exceptional values in measurements.","","","","","","","",,"extensible","Codes specifying why the result (`Observation.value[x]`) is missing.","http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/data-absent-reason|4.0.1","",,,,"Observation.component.dataAbsentReason",0,1,"obs-6

The alternate way is to use the value element for actual observations and use the explicit dataAbsentReason element to record exceptional values.
