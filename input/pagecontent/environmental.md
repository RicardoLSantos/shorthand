# Environmental Factors

## Overview
This module describes how environmental data collected from the iOS Health App is mapped to FHIR resources. These data are crucial for assessing exposure to environmental factors that may impact health.

## Data Sources
Environmental data is collected through:
- iPhone (built-in sensors)
- Apple Watch
- Integrated environmental monitoring apps
- Connected environmental monitoring devices

## Types of Collected Data

### 1. Audio Exposure
- Exposure level in decibels (dB)
- Duration of exposure
- Peak moments
- Dangerous level alerts
- Exposure history
- Sound pressure level measurements
- Daily noise dose calculation

### 2. Environmental Noise
- Continuous noise levels
- Daily variations
- Exposure patterns
- Associated locations
- Critical periods
- Background noise analysis
- Quiet time periods

### 3. UV Exposure
- UV index measurements
- Exposure duration
- Time of exposure
- Intensity levels
- Protection recommendations
- Cumulative exposure
- Risk assessments

## Collection Frequency
- Noise: Continuous monitoring
- UV: During sun exposure
- Alerts: Real-time
- Analysis: Daily and weekly aggregation

## FHIR Resources
Environmental data is mapped to FHIR Observation resources with specific profiles:
- AudioExposureObservation
- EnvironmentalNoiseObservation
- UVExposureObservation

## Supported Operations
- Search by date
- Search by exposure type
- Search by intensity level
- Aggregate reports

## Implementation Considerations
1. Data Validation
   - Sensor calibration
   - Measurement accuracy
   - Data consistency checks
   - Outlier detection

2. Privacy & Security
   - Location data protection
   - Personal exposure data
   - Data aggregation rules
   - Access controls

3. Clinical Integration
   - Health impact assessment
   - Risk factor analysis
   - Prevention recommendations
   - Clinical decision support
