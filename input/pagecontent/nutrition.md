# Nutrition

## General Description
This module describes how nutritional data collected from the iOS Health App and through questionnaires are mapped to FHIR resources. Nutritional data is essential for assessment and intervention in lifestyle medicine.

## Data Sources
Nutritional data is collected from:
- iOS Health App (automatic data)
- User-completed questionnaires 
- Integrated nutrition apps
- Manual records

## Types of Data Collected

### 1. Hydration
- Water intake volume
- Other non-caloric beverages
- Intake timestamps
- Record source

### 2. Energy
- Total calories consumed
- Distribution by meal
- Meal timestamps
- Energy balance

### 3. Macronutrients
- Carbohydrates (g)
- Proteins (g) 
- Fats (g)
  - Saturated
  - Unsaturated
  - Trans

### 4. Micronutrients
- Vitamins
- Minerals
- Electrolytes

### 5. Other
- Caffeine
- Fiber
- Alcohol

## FHIR Resources
The nutritional data is mapped to FHIR resources with specific profiles for each type of measurement:

### Observations
- Nutrition intake observations
- Hydration observations
- Energy/caloric intake
- Nutrient measurements

### Care Plans
- Nutrition care plans
- Dietary recommendations
- Supplementation plans

### Goals
- Nutritional goals
- Hydration targets
- Weight management goals

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Validation
- Physiological range validation
- Consistency checks
- Cross-validation between related measurements
- Unit standardization

### Privacy & Security  
- Data anonymization
- Access control
- Audit logging
- Consent management

## Questionnaire to Observation Mapping

### QuestionnaireResponse to Observation
| Questionnaire Item | FHIR Observation |
|-------------------|------------------|
| water_intake | WaterIntakeObservation |
| calories | CalorieIntakeObservation |
| macronutrients | MacronutrientsObservation |

### Transformation Rules
1. Each meal response generates:
   - A calorie observation
   - A macronutrients observation
  
2. Daily Aggregations:
   - Total calories
   - Total macronutrients
   - Total water
   - Total caffeine

3. Validations:
   - Sum of macronutrients in grams
   - Calorie calculation from macronutrients
   - Values within physiological ranges

### Implementation Notes
- Each QuestionnaireResponse is processed into multiple Observations
- Timestamps from meal records are preserved in Observations
- Aggregations are performed at the end of each day
- All measurements include source attribution

## Implementation Considerations

### Data Flow
1. Collection
   - Questionnaire completion
   - App integration
   - iOS Health App data

2. Processing
   - Data validation
   - Derived calculations
   - Aggregations

3. Storage
   - QuestionnaireResponse
   - Observations
   - History

### Validations
1. Raw Data
   - Valid ranges
   - Temporal consistency
   - Completeness

2. Calculations
   - Macronutrient balance
   - Caloric equivalence
   - Daily goals

### UX Considerations
1. Questionnaire Interface
   - Easy completion
   - Default values
   - Real-time validation

2. Feedback
   - Daily progress
   - Goal alerts
   - Suggestions

### Technical Aspects
1. Device Integration
   - HealthKit permissions
   - Data synchronization
   - Offline support

2. Performance
   - Batch processing
   - Query optimization
   - Data aggregation strategies

3. Security
   - Data encryption
   - Access control
   - Audit logging
