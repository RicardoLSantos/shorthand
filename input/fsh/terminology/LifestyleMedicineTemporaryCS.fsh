Title: "Lifestyle Medicine Temporary Codes"
Description: "Temporary codes for lifestyle medicine concepts not yet covered by standard terminologies (LOINC, SNOMED CT, ICD-11). Following the Physical Activity IG 'Temporary Codes' pattern, these codes are candidates for proposal to standard code systems. Consolidated from domain-specific CodeSystems to align with HL7 FHIR IG best practices (cf. mCODE, PA IG, US Core)."
