# Stress Assessment Module

## Overview
This module describes how stress data collected from iOS Health App sensors and user inputs are mapped to FHIR resources for lifestyle medicine interventions.

## Data Sources
- Heart Rate Variability (HRV) from Apple Watch 
- Blood pressure patterns
- Activity patterns
- Self-reported stress levels
- Mindfulness session data
- Sleep quality metrics

## Types of Data Collected

### 1. Physiological Stress Metrics
- Heart rate variability analysis
- Blood pressure patterns  
- Respiratory rate changes
- Sleep disruption
- Physical activity impact

### 2. Psychological Stress Assessment
- Perceived stress levels
- Mood changes
- Anxiety indicators
- Cognitive impacts
- Behavioral changes

### 3. Stress Response Patterns
- Acute vs chronic stress
- Recovery efficiency
- Adaptation capacity
- Resilience metrics
- Coping mechanisms

### 4. Environmental Context
- Location/setting
- Time patterns
- Activity context
- Social factors
- Environmental triggers

## Implementation Considerations

### 1. Data Collection
- Continuous sensor monitoring
- Periodic assessments
- Event-triggered recording
- Context capture
- User input validation

### 2. Analysis Pipeline
- Real-time processing
- Pattern detection
- Trend analysis
- Risk assessment
- Alert generation

### 3. Clinical Integration 
- Care plan updates
- Provider notifications
- Decision support
- Progress tracking
- Outcome measurement

## FHIR Resources

### Core Resources
- Observation: For stress measurements
- Questionnaire: For stress assessments
- CarePlan: For stress management plans
- Goal: For stress reduction targets

### Profiles
- StressLevelProfile
- StressAssessmentProfile
- StressManagementProfile

### Extensions
- StressContext
- StressTriggers
- StressCoping

### Value Sets
- StressChronicityVS
- StressImpactVS
- StressTriggersVS
- StressCopingVS

## iOS Health App to FHIR Mapping

### Core Fields
| iOS Health App | FHIR Path | Description |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| HRV | Observation.component[hrv] | Heart rate variability |
| Stress Level | Observation.valueQuantity | Perceived stress level |
| Context | Observation.component[context] | Environmental context |
| Response | Observation.component[response] | Stress response pattern |

### Mapping Considerations
1. Data Validation
   - Physiological ranges
   - Temporal consistency
   - Context validation
   - Pattern validation

2. Context Handling  
   - Location tracking
   - Activity correlation
   - Social context
   - Environmental factors

3. Clinical Context
   - Care plan integration
   - Provider communication
   - Alert management
   - Progress tracking
