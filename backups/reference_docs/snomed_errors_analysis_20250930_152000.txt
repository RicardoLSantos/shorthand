AFFECTED FILES (estimated):
1. input/fsh/examples/MindfulnessCompleteExamples.fsh
2. input/fsh/examples/MindfulnessExamples.fsh
3. input/fsh/examples/SymptomExamples.fsh
4. input/fsh/examples/EnvironmentalExamples.fsh

NEXT STEPS:
1. Research correct SNOMED CT codes for each concept
2. Identify which files contain these errors
3. Create fix script with proper replacements
4. Consider alternative coding systems (LOINC) where appropriate

NOTE: This requires detailed SNOMED CT terminology research
      using official SNOMED browser or terminology server.
