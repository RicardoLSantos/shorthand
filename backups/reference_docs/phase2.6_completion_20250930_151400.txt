PHASE 2.6 - MESSAGEDEFINITION CONSTRAINTS - COMPLETION REPORT
==============================================================
Generated: 2025-09-30 15:14:00

SUMMARY:
--------
✓ Phase 2.6 completed successfully
✓ All MessageDefinition constraint errors fixed
✓ All Quick Win phases (2.2-2.6) now complete

RESULTS:
--------
Starting errors: 250
Ending errors:   246
Reduction:       -4 errors (-1.6%)
Status:          ✓ SUCCESS - Exactly as predicted!

FIXES APPLIED:
--------------
File: input/fsh/messaging/MindfulnessMessaging.fsh

1. Changed Instance IDs to match canonical URLs:
   - StartSessionMessage → start-session
   - EndSessionMessage → end-session

2. Added focus.max = "*" to both MessageDefinition instances:
   - start-session: Added focus.max after focus.min
   - end-session: Added focus.max after focus.min

ERRORS FIXED:
-------------
1. URL Mismatch Errors (2):
   - start-session: Instance ID now matches URL
   - end-session: Instance ID now matches URL

2. md-1 Constraint Violations (2):
   - start-session: focus.max now defined as "*"
   - end-session: focus.max now defined as "*"

BACKUP CREATED:
---------------
backups/backup_fsh/MindfulnessMessaging_20250930_150542.fsh

VALIDATION:
-----------
- IG Publisher run completed successfully
- SUSHI compilation: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- Final validation: 246 errors (down from 250)

PHASE 2 OVERALL PROGRESS:
--------------------------
Starting errors (after jurisdiction fix): 283
Ending errors (after all Quick Wins):     246
Total Quick Win reduction:                -37 errors (-13.1%)

PHASES COMPLETED:
-----------------
✓ Phase 2.2: ValueSet Binding Codes
✓ Phase 2.3: Canonical URL Mismatches (-18 errors)
✓ Phase 2.4: Observation Category Codes (-11 errors)
✓ Phase 2.5: Consent Display Names & Codes (-4 errors)
✓ Phase 2.6: MessageDefinition Constraints (-4 errors)

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
All Quick Win phases complete. Remaining 246 errors require:

Phase 3 - Research-Intensive Tasks:
  - Phase 3.1: SNOMED CT code validation (~20 errors)
  - Phase 3.2: LOINC code validation (~12 errors)
  - Phase 3.3: StructureDefinition fixes (~200 errors)
  - Phase 3.4: StructureMap validation (~5 errors)

RECOMMENDATION:
---------------
Proceed with Phase 3.1 (SNOMED CT validation) using Opus 4 for
detailed terminology research and code validation against SNOMED CT
International Edition.

OVERALL PROJECT PROGRESS:
-------------------------
Initial errors:  469 (at start of continuation session)
Current errors:  246
Total reduction: -223 errors (-47.5% reduction achieved!)

This completes all straightforward "Quick Win" fixes. Remaining
errors require deeper research and terminology expertise.
