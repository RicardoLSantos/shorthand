===================================
Generated: 2025-10-01 07:45:00
Total LOINC errors identified: ~28 errors

The LOINC codes in the IG are COMPLETELY WRONG - they reference
unrelated medical tests (microbiology, allergy tests, audiometry)
instead of lifestyle/wellness measurements.

SUMMARY OF ISSUES:
==================
Total errors: ~28 LOINC code errors

Breakdown by type:
- Completely wrong codes (need replacement): ~21 codes
- Unknown codes (not in LOINC 2.80): 2 codes (291-7, 28573-7)
- Display name issues only: ~5 codes (physical activity codes seem OK)

AFFECTED FILES:
===============
- input/fsh/examples/VitalSignsExamples.fsh (body composition)
- input/fsh/examples/EnvironmentalExamples.fsh (noise exposure)
- input/fsh/examples/PhysicalActivityExamples.fsh
- input/fsh/examples/SleepExamples.fsh
- input/fsh/examples/SocialInteractionExamples.fsh
- input/fsh/examples/StressExamples.fsh

ROOT CAUSE:
===========
It appears that LOINC codes were either:
1. Made up / invented (incorrect codes)
2. Randomly selected from LOINC database
3. Copied from wrong sources

Many of these lifestyle/wellness measurements may NOT have
standardized LOINC codes, as LOINC primarily focuses on
laboratory tests and clinical measurements.

RECOMMENDED APPROACH:
=====================
1. Search LOINC database for actual codes for:
   - Body composition measurements
   - Environmental noise monitoring
   - Sleep tracking metrics
   - Social interaction measures
   - Stress assessment scores

2. For concepts without LOINC codes, consider:
   - Using SNOMED CT codes instead
   - Creating local codes with proper namespacing
   - Using existing wearable device terminologies

3. Consult LOINC documentation for:
   - Personal health device codes
   - Consumer health informatics codes
   - Behavioral health measures

NEXT STEPS:
===========
This requires EXTENSIVE research with LOINC database and potentially
Opus 4 to find or determine proper codes for each concept.

PRIORITY: HIGH - These errors significantly impact interoperability.
